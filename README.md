# Sulos

This is a basic operating system im making for fun.
Im planning to implement a functional terminal which can interract with the drive and run executables.
I will also create a basic graphics library and hopefully a driver for 10 series NVIDIA GPUS which will hopefully be compatible with other GPUS.
This is currently bootable on real hardware but certain functions are unfinished
