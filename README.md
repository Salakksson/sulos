# pushos
This is a basic operating system im making for fun.
Im planning to implement a functional terminal which can interract with the drive and run executables.
I will also create a basic graphics library and hopefully a driver for 10 series NVIDIA GPUS which will hopefully be compatible with other GPUS.
Im want to make this bootable on real hardware using UEFI boot in the future.

The makefiles and parts of the bootloader are copied but the rest of the OS is unique.
